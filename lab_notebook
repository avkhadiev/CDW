     TODO: need a convenient way to characterize a transition
           phases are fixed at the impurity sites; visually, a transition 
           would look like a rapid movement of a part a wave from one 
           impurity site to another, but it is not clear how to track that
    
           via site-specific phase values. 
           e.g., one could track the phase value at the impurity, 
           and save a pair of numbers 
    
           ( abs( phi - beta mod 2 ) pi - pi/2 , time ) 
    
           to then graph a time evolution of the phase as a function of time.
           call the first number "phi_trans"
    
           Thus, a phase transition is an event that:
              - in its time span contains the moment 
                  t_switch when sin( phi_trans ) = 0
              - starts t_start: the earliest moment before t_switch when 
                  sin( phi_trans ) = +1 or -1
              - ends when t_end: the earliest moment after t_switch when
                  sin( phi_trans ) = -1 or +1
              - does not contain 
                  sin( phi_trans ) = +1 or -1 between t_switch and t_end.

        Moreover, one could use the above formula --
            
            sin( (abs( phi_j - beta_j ) mod 2 pi) - pi/2 )

        To visualize motion of phases at each site. If we have no impurities 
        and a small electric field, this function at each site will be 
        changing smoothly from -1 to 0 to 1, down from 1 to 0 to -1, and so on.

      TODO: make sure each simulation provides the following statistics:
               - mean transition time per impurity 
               - mean velocity of the phase during transition per impurity
               - mean number of transitions per unit time per impurity
