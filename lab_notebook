     TODO: need a convenient way to characterize a transition
           phases are fixed at the impurity sites; visually, a transition 
           would look like a rapid movement of a part a wave from one 
           impurity site to another, but it is not clear how to track that
    
           via site-specific phase values. 
           e.g., one could track the phase value at the impurity, 
           and save a pair of numbers 
    
           ( abs( phi - beta mod 2 ) pi - pi/2 , time ) 
    
           to then graph a time evolution of the phase as a function of time.
           call the first number "phi_trans"
    
           Thus, a phase transition is an event that:
              - in its time span contains the moment 
                  t_switch when sin( phi_trans ) = 0
              - starts t_start: the earliest moment before t_switch when 
                  sin( phi_trans ) = +1 or -1
              - ends when t_end: the earliest moment after t_switch when
                  sin( phi_trans ) = -1 or +1
              - does not contain 
                  sin( phi_trans ) = +1 or -1 between t_switch and t_end.

        Moreover, one could use the above formula --
            
            sin( (abs( phi_j - beta_j ) mod 2 pi) - pi/2 )

        To visualize motion of phases at each site. If we have no impurities 
        and a small electric field, this function at each site will be 
        changing smoothly from -1 to 0 to 1, down from 1 to 0 to -1, and so on.

      TODO: make sure each simulation provides the following statistics:
               - mean transition time per impurity 
               - mean velocity of the phase during transition per impurity
               - mean number of transitions per unit time per impurity

    momentum conservation shows that my thermal noise is not random enough.
    I've tried uniform and Gaussian distributions. Over 50000 steps of duration
    0.01, with elasticity of order 1.0, no field, and noise comparable to 
    elasticity, I get order of 100 (plus or minus) overall change in momentum.
    The mean momentum then is ~10^(-4). This may suggest that anything beyond 
    that precision is not reliable, unless I fix the random number generation...
