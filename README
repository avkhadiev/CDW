MD simulation of charge-density waves (CDWs) tunnelling through lattice 
impurities.

TODO:
- run a simulation with few sights and no impurities. 
- achieve uniformly changing phase with no impurities and a small DC field 
- achieve uniformly changing phase with no impurities and stochastic forcing.
